Technologies Used
Backend: Flask, for building a robust and interactive web interface.
Data Processing: pandas for data manipulation, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and requests for API integration.
Machine Learning: scikit-learn for clustering models and feature preprocessing.
Visualization: matplotlib for generating visual insights into the data.
How It Works
Data Collection: The app pulls data from various sources, processes it, and saves it in a structured format.
Data Analysis: Visualizations are created to explore data characteristics and understand underlying patterns.
Clustering Model: The app applies clustering techniques to segment the market data, providing insights into potential market trends and fluctuations.
User Interface: Users can interact with the app through a web interface, trigger data collection and visualization processes, and view insights.
Use Cases and Applications
Market Trend Prediction: By analyzing market sentiment and other key features, the app can provide early indicators of market shifts.
Consumer Behavior Analysis: Identifies how consumer sentiment or review trends correlate with market fluctuations.
Investment Insights: Offers data-driven insights that could be valuable for making investment decisions or understanding economic trends.
