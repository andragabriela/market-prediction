Market Analysis and Prediction Application
This application is a personal project designed to gather, process, and analyze market-related data to make predictions about market fluctuations. It combines data collection, preprocessing, and clustering analysis to provide insights into market behavior and potential trends, using exploratory data visualization and segmentation modeling.
Project Goals and Objectives
The aim of this project is to create a comprehensive market analysis tool that leverages data from various sources to help anticipate market fluctuations. By using data clustering and other machine learning techniques, the app identifies patterns and segments that could be indicators of market trends.
Key Features and Functionalities

1. Data Collection and Integration:
   - Web Scraping: Scrapes data from market-related websites (such as product prices, consumer sentiment, or economic indicators). This feature pulls information like product reviews or price fluctuations, which can be used as proxies for market sentiment.
   - API Data Fetching: Integrates with external APIs to pull economic data or consumer behavior statistics. The data is enriched with randomly assigned sentiment values for modeling purposes.
   - Data Upload: Users can upload their own JSON files containing market-related data, such as transaction histories or price trends, which are validated and saved for further analysis.

2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering:
   - Data Cleaning: Handles missing or inconsistent data points to ensure a high-quality dataset for analysis.
   - Feature Creation: Generates new features, such as review length or market sentiment scores, to enhance the predictive power of the model.
   - Random Data Augmentation: For data sets fetched from APIs, random values are assigned to simulate ratings or market sentiment.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualizations: 
     - Sentiment Distribution: A pie chart to understand market sentiment, categorized as positive, neutral, or negative.
     - Data Length and Rating Distribution: Histograms that show the distribution of content length and sentiment scores, helping to identify data patterns.
     - Cluster Visualization: A scatter plot showing clusters based on market sentiment and other key features.
   - Trend Analysis: Provides insights into how sentiment and other factors may be influencing market behavior.

4. Segmentation and Clustering Model:
   - K-Means Clustering: Applies clustering to segment market data into groups. Each cluster can represent a specific market condition or consumer segment.
   - Preprocessing: Uses techniques like feature scaling and normalization to prepare the data for clustering.
   - Cluster Analysis: Analyzes the characteristics of each cluster, such as average sentiment score and content length, to understand what factors drive each market segment.
   - Visualization of Clusters: A graphical representation of clusters to see how different segments of the market are distributed.

5. Market Prediction and Insights:
   - Segmentation Insights: Helps understand how different segments behave, which can be used to predict market trends.
   - Potential Predictive Features: Identifies which features are most correlated with market fluctuations, such as sudden changes in sentiment or shifts in product review trends.
